This is a Rogue-like item generator for Pathfinder, which was inspired primarily by playing too much Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.
These items are meant to be rolled up when a rare item or (potentially) valuable loot is called for. This script makes use of
exponential probability distributions which are determined by book prices for items. All named items are taken from Ultimate
Equipment.

Item types include rings, weapons, armor, shields, staves, rods, and wonderous items. Item modifiers include enchantment bonuses
for weapons and shields as well as magical properties. Some weapons will have poison effects.  All items may also confer energy
resistances, damage reduction, stat bonuses (and penalties). The probabilities of these bonuses are related to the corresponding
book prices. Wonderous items are always generated without modification.

There is a fixed 5% chance that a random type item will be a cursed item instead. There is also a small chance that worthless
items such as peanuts or sticks may be generated as well.
